/*
Congratulations! You've successfully thrown, caught, and handled an exception.
Recap

Here are a few important things to remember from this unit:

    Ensure that your debug environment is configured to support your application requirements.
    Method code should throw an exception when an issue or condition is detected.
    Exceptions should be caught at a level in the call stack where they can be resolved.
