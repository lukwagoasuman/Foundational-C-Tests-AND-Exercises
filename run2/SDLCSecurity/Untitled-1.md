/*
Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

    Configure the Visual Studio Code debugger for a C# program.
    Create breakpoints and step through your code to isolate issues.
    Inspect your program state at any execution step.
    Use the call stack to find the source of an exception.

Ultimately, you'll be able to isolate code bugs efficiently using the debugger tools, and you won't need to rely on Console.WriteLine anymore.
Prerequisites

    An installation of Visual Studio Code that's configured for C# application development.
    Ability to develop C# console applications that implement business logic using iteration statements, selection statements, and custom methods.
    A basic understanding of code debuggers and the debug process.

/*
Recap

Here are a few important things to remember from this unit:

    The Visual Studio Code user interface can be used to configure, start, and manage debug sessions. The launch.json file contains the launch configurations for your application.
    The Run menu provides easy access to common run and debug commands grouped into six sections.
    The RUN AND DEBUG view provides access to runtime tools, including the Run and Debug controls panel. The sections of the RUN AND DEBUG view are VARIABLES, WATCH, CALL STACK, and BREAKPOINTS.
    The Debug toolbar provides execution controls while your application is running such as pause/continue, step over, step into, step out, restart and stop.
    The DEBUG CONSOLE is used to display messages from the debugger. The DEBUG CONSOLE can also display console output from your application.
